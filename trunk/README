ELepHant is a consequence-based reasoner for the EL+ fragment of Description
Logics. 

Currently it only supports input ontologies from command line in the 
OWL Functional Style Syntax. The supported reasoning task is currently only
classification.

Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ elephant-reasoner input_ontology output_taxonomy


Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ELepHant Reasoner is available both as precompiled binaries and source.
Currently the binary distribution is available for the 64-bit Linux x86 
platform. The binary is statically compiled, i.e., you do not need to install
any external libraries. Binaries for other platforms are on the way.

You can also install ELepHant from the sources. You can get the source 
either as a tarball or check it out from the SVN. For compiling the source you 
need the Judy array library. It is available for various linux distributions.
The package name is libjudy-dev. Alternatively you can get the sources from 
http://sourceforge.net/projects/judy/

Compiling:
----------

Untar the tarball: 
$ tar zxvf ELepHant-reasoner-0.1.1.tar.gz

Change to the source directory
$ cd ELepHant-reasoner-0.1.1

Run the configure script with
$ ./configure

(If you installed the Judy library in a non-standard location, tell the 
configure script about the location of the library and the header file Judy.h)

Then run make:
$ make

If everything goes right, install it with:
$ make install

The executable elephant-reasoner will be installed in /usr/local/bin

Known bugs:

- Role compositions are currently not working due to a bug. (26.06.2013)
- Outputs separate EquivalentClasses axioms for each pair of equivalent classes
in an equivalence class (25.06.2013)
