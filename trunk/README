ELepHant is a consequence-based reasoner for the EL+ fragment of Description
Logics. 

Currently it only supports input ontologies from command line in the 
OWL Functional Style Syntax. Support for OWL API is planned.

The supported reasoning tasks are the following:
	- classification,
	- consistency, and
	- realization.

ELepHant does not yet support full OWL2 EL. The supported features are the following:
Supported axiom types:
	- SubClassOf
	- EquivalentClasses
	- DisjointClasses
	- SubObjectPropertyOf
	- EquivalentObjectProperties
	- TransitiveObjectProperty
	- ClassAssertion
	- ObjectPropertyAssertion 

Supported class expressions:
	- owl:Thing
	- owl:Nothing
	- ObjectIntersectionOf
	- ObjectSomeValuesFrom

Supported property expressions:
	- ObjectPropertyChain 

Supported Individual expressions:
	- NamedIndividual

Installation
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ELepHant Reasoner is available both as precompiled binaries and source.
Currently the binary distribution is available for the 64-bit Linux x86 
platform. The binary is statically compiled, i.e., you do not need to install
any external libraries. Binaries for other platforms are on the way.

You can also install ELepHant from the sources. It does not depend on any external
library. You can get the source either as a tarball or check it out from the SVN. 

Compiling:
----------

Untar the tarball: 
$ tar zxvf ELepHant-reasoner-0.3.0.tar.gz

Change to the source directory
$ cd ELepHant-reasoner-0.3.0

Run the configure script with
$ ./configure

Then run make:
$ make

If everything goes right, the executable elephant-reasoner will be created in the
src directory. You can install it with:
$ make install

The executable elephant-reasoner will be installed in /usr/local/bin


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
$ elephant-reasoner -i input_ontology -o output_taxonomy -r reasoning_task

where reasoning task is one of classification, consistency or realisation.

If run with the verbose option "-v", ELepHant prints detailed information about 
the input ontology (like the number of axioms, classes etc.) and statistical information 
about reasoning (like runtimes, number of inferred axioms, etc.)
