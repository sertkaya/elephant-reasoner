	- Optimize treatment of role composition hierarchy. The current implementation generates
	too many new role compositions in role saturation, that can be reduced.
	
	- Optimize the preprocessing of disjointness axioms. The current implementation introduces
	n^2 new subclass axioms for a disjointness axiom containing n concepts.
